# Technical test (React)



For this technical test you’ll have to create an entire project about viewing posts, like the best known Wordpress !

## 1/ Main instructions

You have to create a website which proposes some functionalities, such as adding post, listing them, deleting them, selecting only one containing all the comments.

We’ll look your ability to create and manage features that are not listed above.These must be relevant for your website.

Base yourself on popular blogs if you need more inspiration.

In this test you should use almost all JS tools like creating components, actions, reducers, SPA, an algorithm for relevant searches.

## 2/ Indications

You can use the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), but you can use another API if you find it more relevent.

The review will focus on main points, not just on functionalities, so think about your project design before developing your website.

Precisely on your structure, the research quality, ergonomics, user interaction and so on.

Your code must be clean, go along with React/Redux standards (e.g [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)), have clear variable names and be commented.

To push your result, just add a new branch in this repository with
*[FIRSTNAME]_[LASTNAME]* and do a pull request.


Good luck ;)
